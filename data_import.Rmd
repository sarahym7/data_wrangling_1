first load tidyverse library because the functions we are going to use exist in the package, more specific the readr


```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

```


## Read in some data

Read in the litters data set. FYI read_csv is a function that exists in the readr's package
read_csv("write your relative path") so we read as "./from this starting point in folder datawrangling go to data folder and go into fas_litters.csv)

```{r}

litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")

```

Now cleaning data, this example has variables not in snakecase 
```{r}
litters_df= janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

to change the names we will use a certain function in a certain package -> janitor, we can also load package but doesnt matter bc we just want to use one function. 

## Take a look at the data
