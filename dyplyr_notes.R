#dplyr package will always be coming from a dataframe first, select and filter a data.frame
#piping is connecting multiple steps 
#piping is a sequence of actions 


# ex. happy_jeff = do_ds(brush_teeth(wake_up(asleep_jeff)))
# awake_jeff = =wakeup(asleep_jeff)
# clean_teeth_jeff = brush_teeth(awake_jeff)
# happy_jeff = do_ds(clean_teeth_jeff)

#Although we can see that they are building off of eachother its more complicated to read

#In this class we will learn 

#happy_jeff =
#wake_up(asleep_jeff) %>%
#brush_teeth() %>%
#do_ds

#works well with tibble in and tibble out dyplr function for what comes in and out of the dataframe
